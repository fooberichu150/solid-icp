# SOLID Interface Segregation Principle

Code in this repository was created for my blog post [Getting Solid with SOLID - Part 4- Interface Segregation Principle](https://www.seeleycoder.com/blog/solid-part-4-interface-segregation-principle/).

### Disclaimer

Code in this repository serves and example to highlight SOLID Interface Segregation Principle.  The actual implementation of the code is "sample worthy" meaning take it with a grain of salt but exercise more thought when implementing production code.  In other words, there are much better ways to implement the factories, etc., than the examples provided here.
